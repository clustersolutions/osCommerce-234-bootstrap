The responsive osCommerce build with all the should've been standard add-ons incorporated. Yeah, let's build this once so you can add from here...oh, database schema changes are incorporated into the installation...

HG === Holy Grail (Ok my "holy grail" but I've been in the online retail trenches using OSC for 10 years)

Mods Installed (mods are like building blocks, you can help by adding one):

1. SEO_Header_Tag.
2. Ultimate SEO URLs5 (cache using MySQL causes error...TBD).
